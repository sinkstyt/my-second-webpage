  <h2>Dani's Pets</h2>
  <p><em>Tigger</em> is a 15-year-old shitzhu. <em>Indra</em> is a small black cat with a tuxedo pattern. She is approximately 4 years
    old, but we're not entirely sure because she was a rescue.</p>
  <h2>Diego's Pets</h2>
  <p><strong>Bean</strong> is a 16lb chonky boy. He is about a year and half old. He was an anniversary gift to my girlfriend and we also rescued him from the local shelter. He was the last kitten out of 28 because he was afraid of people and would hiss a lot. he is all black and we are not sure what breed he is but i think he has some mane coon in him cause he is very large. His favorite things to do are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eat</li>
    <li>Sleep</li>
    <li>And eat some more</li>
  </ul>
